# The AI Augmented SDLC
## Chapter 0: Introduction - The Intersection of AI and Agile SDLC

Welcome to our exploration of the fusion between artificial intelligence (AI) and the Agile software development life cycle (SDLC). The protagonist of our journey is GPT-4, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI.

GPT-4, a large multimodal model, processes and generates text based on both text and image inputs. Although it doesn't surpass human intelligence in all scenarios, its performance on professional and academic benchmarks is noteworthy. Notably, it displays improvements over its predecessor, GPT-3.5, particularly in the areas of creativity, reliability, and handling nuanced instructions.

In this blog series, "The AI Augmented SDLC," we delve into how AI can integrate into each phase of the Agile SDLC. Rather than focus solely on theory, our aim is to provide practical insights. We will examine the potential roles of GPT-4 and related technologies, such as embeddings, semantic search, and retrieval augmented generation, across the SDLC stages:

1. [**Ideation**](Chapter1.md): AI's potential contribution to product vision conceptualization.
2. [**Feasibility**](Chapter2.md): The potential role of AI in assessing both short and long-term feasibility.
3. [**Requirements**](Chapter3.md): How AI might be used for continuously gathering and prioritizing requirements.
4. [**Design & Coding**](Chapter4.md): The possible role of AI in iterative design, development, and unit test writing.
5. [**Testing**](Chapter5.md): How AI could automate testing and predict potential bugs.
6. [**Deployment**](Chapter6.md): The prospective role of AI in deployment processes.
7. [**Operations**](Chapter7.md): How AI might help in monitoring live environments and optimizing performance.
8. [**Maintenance**](Chapter8.md): The potential role of AI in aiding iterative development and suggesting improvements.
9. [**End of Life**](Chapter9.md): How AI could assist in data migration and system shutdowns.
10. [**Recap**](Chapter10.md): Summarizing the potential roles of AI across each phase of the Agile SDLC, reinforcing the integration of AI and Agile development.
[**Epilogue**](Epilogue.md): An overview of how this series was written.

We aim to provide an in-depth look at these topics, offering practical use-cases and real-world examples of AI within the Agile SDLC. Our objective is to ensure that you gain insights that could help you visualize possible implementations of these AI technologies in your own contexts.

Join us in this insightful exploration as we delve into the potential ways AI could revolutionize the Agile SDLC.
